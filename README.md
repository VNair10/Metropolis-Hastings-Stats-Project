# Metropolis-Hastings-Stats-Project
In recent years, Bayesian techniques have been instrumental in giving superpowers to existing machine learning algorithms. A well-known method for acquiring information about Bayesian model distributions is the Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The MCMC algorithms approximate the posterior distribution by random sampling in a probabilistic space. One such algorithm belonging to MCMC is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (M-H). The M-H algorithm finds its usage in situations where the distribution's analytical form is intractable to sample. In this project, we analyze the Metropolis â€“ Hastings algorithm and discuss its implementation with a real-world example.
